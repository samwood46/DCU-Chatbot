## SECTION B

### Introduction

  

>The areas covered by this project would be Web application, Software development, 
>Search, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning and the overall development of a chat bot.

  

### Outline

  

> We hope to implement a chat bot web-app that accommodates queries made about the DCU 
> campus. For example, a question asked about the facilities or public utilities. The plan is to 
> train our application to respond to the users question effectively. We will do this by using a 
> series of scripts that we will make along with a neural network. For instance, a user might 
> ask the application ‘Where do I collect a student leap card?’ and we would like it to answer 
> instantly ‘The Student’s Union building’.

  
  

### Background

  

> As a group we were interested in working on a project involving Search technologies and 
> Machine learning. We had several project ideas and met with Gareth Jones to discuss 
> them. It was then when Gareth suggested the idea of designing a chat bot service. The idea 
> interested us due to its amalgamation of Information retrieval and Machine Learning. With 
> some further consultation from one of Gareth’s PHD students, we decided to take it on.

  
  

### Achievements

  

> The service will aim to assist DCU students and also people who are on campus for whatever reason, that may have a question about facilities or the public services. Imagine > a first year is using their new timetable and they see a lecture is on in XG21, if they were to ask the chat bot ‘Where is XG21’ and instantly get a reply ‘The Ground Floor of the Science Building’ and a link to the campus map their destination is a lot clearer. We would want the application to be very easy to use in the sense that the chat appears as soon as the application is selected on the device, ie. no login or sign up etc. Another goal for our User Interface is for it to be aesthetically pleasing for the user. An example of an app like > this would be the Facebook messenger app.

  

### Justification

  
> How often do you think someone is unsure about where they need to be to utilize one of DCU’s public services or faces ambiguity when looking for a certain location etc.This web app will act as a public resource for these problems. Not only do we predict this to be useful for new University students, but also Erasmus students, guest speakers, secondary school students on open days, rival sports teams etc. It will also allow staff that regularly deal with student queries to focus on other work as we hope to answer all the questions most frequently asked of services like the Maths Learning Centre, Registry and ISS.

  

### Programming language(s)



> HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python or Java

  

### Programming tools / Tech stack

  

> We hope to use machine learning in our project and this will most likely mean the use of the Python NumPy and tensorflow libraries and other various API's. We will most likely be programming using the Pycharm IDE. If we settle on a web app we will also need a service to host it.
  

### Hardware

  

> N/A

  

### Learning Challenges

> One challenge we may face is that neither one of us has designed ether a web-app or a chat bot before, this project will be a big learning experience for the both of us. Our module on advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence taught us about the basics of AI but In our third year projects only one of us worked with machine learning. This may prove to be an obstacle as one partner has more experience in this field than the other. A possible learning challenge is also processing natural language and handling queries when dealing with a chat bot as there are so many ways people may ask the same question. Another obstacle is that we had different project partners in third year and having not worked on any group assignments together we are yet to see how we work as a team. Designing for ease of use by the general public may prove tricky to make intuitive to all users, we will have to look into various design principles such as Gestalt principles in order to have a well designed application.
  

### Breakdown of work
  

#### Student 1(Mark Agnew)

  

> For this project I will be working mostly on the front end so the design aspects to make it user friendly and intuitive. I also plan on working on producing server code for the purpose of testing access to the web app from another machines. But obviously if it was to be used by colleges this web app would sit on their web servers. For integrating the back end code myself and my partner will work together in order to reduce the chances of unforeseen bugs. We will also work on the documentation together by doing the writing up of our own parts then reviewing documents as a whole to ensure coherence. I also plan on writing unit tests wherever applicable and also carrying out tasks such as heuristic analysis of the front end design, we will both work together for integration and user testing.We also plan on carrying out peer review of code in order to try and  reduce the amount of bugs/errors.

  

#### Student 2(Sam Wood)

  

> I plan to implement the algorithm that helps users with any queries they have about the campus. If possible 
we will use a machine learning algorithm to train the chat bot, but for the first stage we will use various 
information retrival techniques. I will also be designing the dataset of potential questions to make the 
application as usable as it can be. The functionality will be implemented in Python with the Pycharm IDE. It will 
be up to me to make the chatbot capable of answering as many questions about the DCU campus as it can. To do 
this I will contact departments such as registry to enquire about what they are asked most frequently. I will also have the help of
one of Gareth Jones' PHD students who specializes in this area. Aswell, I will be unit testing this section of the project 
with PyUnit. Both partners will be taking on the documentation side of the project like functional spec, user manual etc.
We will also be conducting peer reviews regularly when there are updates.
